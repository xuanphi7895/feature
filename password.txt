By default, if you don't customise anything, Identity configures a default set of validation rules for new passwords:

Passwords must be at least 6 characters
Passwords must have at least one lowercase ('a'-'z')
Passwords must have at least one uppercase ('A'-'Z')
Passwords must have at least one digit ('0'-'9')
Passwords must have at least one non alphanumeric character
If you want to change these values, to increase the minimum length for example, you can do so when you add Identity to the DI container in ConfigureServices. In the following example I've increased the minimum password length from 6 to 10, and disabled the other validations:
